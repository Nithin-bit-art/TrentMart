createAsyncThunk
----------------

A function that accepts a Redux action type string and a callback function that should return a promise. 
It generates promise lifecycle action types based on the action type prefix that you pass in, and returns 
a thunk action creator that will run the promise callback and dispatch the lifecycle actions based on the returned promise.
